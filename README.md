# Network Analysis Submission 2
This is an analysis of 18th and 19th century logbooks. To run code add the respective file (https://data.world/cliwoc/ocean-ship-logbooks-1750-1850) named as "logbooks.csv" to the data directory and run "python analysis.py".
The .ipynb is identical but offers the chance to understand manipulations step by step.
